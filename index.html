	    <td width="450">I am a first year medical student at the University of British 
		    Columbia (UBC) and an aspiring clinician-innovator. I hold a BASc (CPEN, '15) and MASc (BME, '17) from UBC as well. 
		    I was previously a Research Engineer simultaneously under two labs: the <a href="http://rcl.ece.ubc.ca/">Robotics and Control Lab</a> 
		    and the <a href="http://urology.med.ubc.ca/transplantation-and-mis/surgical-technologies-experimental-laboratory-and-advanced-robotics-stellar-facility/">STELLAR Lab</a>.
		    There, I focused on innovation and commercialization in anesthesia, maternal health and urology. I firmly believe in the power of technology to improve the
		    methods of medicine and the lives of patients and healthcare providers. 
		    
		    My current research interests include medical image processing, computer vision, mobile application development, and technology-based quality improvement initiatives. 

    	    <p> My graduate work, "Intra-operative Ultrasound-based Augmented Reality for Laparoscopic Surgery" was supervised by 
		Prof. Rob Rohling. This was at the intersection of ultrasound imaging, augmented reality, and surgical robotics
		as applied to kidney cancer surgery. For this work, I won Best Clinical Paper at the 2017 Annual UBC Urology 
		Research Day and Best Paper at the 2017 Augmented Environments for Computer Assisted Interventions (AE-CAI) Workshop.

	   <p>An easy-to-read snapshot of this work can be found
		<a href="http://stories.innovation.ubc.ca/augmented-reality-in-minimally-invasive-surgery/" target="_blank">
		here</a>. My publications are available
		<a href="https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=YslDOD8AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=sra" target="_blank">here</a>.
	    </p>
	    <p> Currently, I am a <a target="_blank" href="https://ubcmj.med.ubc.ca/about/our-team/">journal editor</a>,
		    a class representative,
		    a student affairs advisor, and
		    a novice sketcher.
	    </p>
		    
	    <p> In the past, I have been a 
		<a href="https://www.hatchinghealth.ca" target="_blank"> director for a medical innovation event</a>, 
		<a href="http://www.citr.ca/radio/sharing-science/" target="_blank"> radio show host</a>,
		<a href="http://www.ubcorbit.com/" target="_blank">nano-satellite developer</a>,
