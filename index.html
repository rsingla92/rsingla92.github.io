	    <td width="450">I am a medical student (Year 1) at the University of British 
		    Columbia (UBC). I received a MASc (BME, '17) and BASc (CPEN, '15) from UBC as well. 
		    I was previously a Research Engineer in two labs: the <a href="http://rcl.ece.ubc.ca/">Robotics and Control Lab</a> 
		    and the <a href="http://urology.med.ubc.ca/transplantation-and-mis/surgical-technologies-experimental-laboratory-and-advanced-robotics-stellar-facility/">STELLAR Lab</a>.
		    There, I focused on innovation and commercialization in anesthesia and urology. I firmly believe in the power of technology to improve the
		    methods of medicine and the lives of others. 

    	    <p> My graduate work, "Intra-operative Ultrasound-based Augmented Reality for Laparoscopic Surgery" was supervised by 
		Prof. Rob Rohling. This was at the intersection of ultrasound imaging, augmented reality, and surgical robotics
		with applications to improve kidney cancer surgery. For this work, I won Best Clinical Paper at the 2017 Annual UBC Urology 
		Research Day and Best Paper at the 2017 Augmented Environments for Computer Assisted Interventions (AE-CAI) Workshop.

	   <p>An easy-to-read snapshot of this work can be found

	    </p>
		    
	    <p> In the past, I have been a 
		<a href="https://www.hatchinghealth.ca" target="_blank"> director for a medical innovation event</a>, 
		<a href="http://www.citr.ca/radio/sharing-science/" target="_blank"> radio show host</a>,
