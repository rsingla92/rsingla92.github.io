			I am a MASc student in the Robotics and Control Lab at the University of British Columbia. Here, I am an <a href="http://www.bme.ubc.ca/graduate/prospective/engineers-in-scrubs/">Engineers in Scrubs</a> fellow, a clinically immersive medical innovation program. I am supervised jointly by Prof. Robert Rohling and Prof. Purang Abolmaesumi. I firmly believe in the power of technology to improve the methods of medicine and the lives of others. 

<p> My research is at the intersection of ultrasound imaging, augmented reality, surgical robotics with applications to improve kidney cancer surgery. I look to answer the question of "how can we provide the surgeon with guidance using ultrasound imaging to overcome the difficulties of surgery"? Take a look at some of my publications <a href="https://scholar.google.ca/citations?user=YslDOD8AAAAJ&hl=en&oi=sra">here</a>.</p>
<p> Currently, I am co-director for <a href="https://www.hatchinghealth.ca">Hatching Health</a>, a local medical innovation event. In the past, I have been a radio show host, mini-satellite developer, student team advisor, football coach, club president, conference organizer, mentor, and a few other things.</p>
<p> 
		<p> I'm always interested in new projects, initiatives, or ideas. Feel free to reach out.</p>
